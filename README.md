# Genetic Algorithms: The Knapsack Problem

## Introduction  
This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve the **Knapsack Problem**—an optimization problem where we aim to maximize the value of selected items while respecting weight and volume constraints.

## Problem Description  
You have a bag that can carry a maximum of **500kg** and has **30 m³** of space.  
Your goal is to **maximize the total value** of the items you carry **without exceeding** these limits.  

Each item has:  
- **Weight (kg)**  
- **Value ($)**  
- **Volume (m³)**  

### **Item Data (Sample)**  

| ID  | Weight (kg) | Value ($) | Volume (m³) |
|-----|------------|----------|-------------|
| 1   | 15         | 40       | 0.5         |
| 2   | 23         | 65       | 0.8         |
| 3   | 7          | 35       | 0.3         |
| ... | ...        | ...      | ...         |
| 50  | 6         | 32       | 0.25        |

*The full dataset includes 50 items, each with weight, value, and volume.*

## Genetic Algorithm Approach  
The algorithm starts with **n randomly generated solutions** and evolves them over multiple generations using **selection, crossover, and mutation**.  

### **Selection Methods:**  
1. **Elitism** – Automatically selects the best solutions to carry over.  
2. **Tournament Selection** – Two random solutions compete, and the better one is chosen for reproduction.  

### **Reproduction Process:**  
- Each reproduction cycle uses **two parents** to create **two children**.  
- The children inherit traits from both parents through **crossover**.  
- Each child has a chance of **mutation** to introduce diversity.  
- This process continues for **n generations** until a satisfactory solution is found.

## Installation and Setup  
*(Instructions on dependencies and setup will be added later.)*

## Future Improvements  
- Add different selection strategies (Roulette Wheel, Rank Selection)  
- Optimize performance using parallel processing  
- Implement a GUI for visualizing results
